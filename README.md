I built a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model using Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to predict the type of iris flower based on its petal and sepal size. First, I cleaned the dataset by removing extra columns and converting the flower names into numbers. Then, I scaled the features so that all measurements were on the same scale. I trained the model using different values of K (from 1 to 10) to see which gave the best results. I tested the model using accuracy and a confusion matrix to check how well it performed. To make the results easier to understand, I used PCA to reduce the data to two dimensions and created a graph that showed how the model makes its predictions. The model gave very good results, and the visual output helped clearly show how KNN works. This project helped me learn more about machine learning, testing models, and showing results with visuals.
